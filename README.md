# DataStructures and Algorithms Visualizer

The app purpose is to show how different algorithms work at each step and also dataStructures.

## App implementation

The app is two parts server and client connected with web socket,
the server runs the algorithm and sends the results to the client so that the client can display it.

for now the client logs the results in the console in the future it will be replaced with UI usong React.

the app could be made in the client side only but i prefered to use server and client so that i can practice web sockets.
